					<p>Adapt or die.</p>
					<p>After years of DVD decline, content owners have adapted, increasingly looking for digital outlets and solutions for their wares. And along with the content owners, the replicators have adapted as well. Once focused on disc, the three major replicators — Sony DADC, Cinram and Technicolor — all have made major inroads in the digital realm.</p>
					<p>The global shift toward greater consumer demand for access and control over content, paired with all the new media platforms vying for consumer attention, has put the pressure on both content owners and replicators to, as one Sony DADC executive puts it: “navigate new digital complexities — and quickly.”</p>
					<p>"As we continue to push more into digital arenas and the marriage of disc and digital experiences become more popular with consumers, we must help our customers deliver that seamless journey between physical and digital worlds," said Dieter Daum, president and CEO of Sony DADC.</p>
					<p>Calling them simple “replicators” today is no longer accurate, as they continue to adapt to the growing digital needs of their clients. Sony DADC’s launch of the LOOT Entertainment on Demand system, Cinram’s acquisition and leveraging of 1K Studios, and Technicolor’s launch of the M-GO digital consumer brand all are just recent examples of major digital moves by the big three.</p>
					<p>Jim Bottoms, company director and co-founder of Futuresource Consulting, said that despite the low revenue margins for replicators in the digital space, it’s no surprise they’re branching out.</p>
					<p>"I think the difference in the digital space is there are so many people looking to get into it, and looking to play a part, and that’s what you’re seeing with [replicators]," he said.</p>
					<p>As the demand for supply chain solutions beyond disc grows, these companies’ innovations — from digital storage to targeting consumers directly — will only become more crucial as the home entertainment industry adapts to consumer demands.</p>
					<p>Sony DADC Bolsters Digital Services</p>
					<p>Two years ago Sony DADC saw what was coming and created its New Media Solutions group, with the express purpose of providing digital supply chain solutions. From creation to consumption, DADC’s global group provides services for content creation, automated digital distribution applications and marketplace services, covering movies, TV, music, games, marketing, social platforms and more.</p>
					<p>"This constantly evolving global media market demands a clear new vision to help content providers thrive," Daum said. "The essence of Sony DADC New Media Solutions is simple: helping content owners maximize every consumer experience by providing innovative best-of-breed applications that create and distribute content in every format, on every channel and for every new device — anywhere in the world.</p>
					<p>"We provide a simplified digital supply chain ecosystem for today’s media universe that can help the industry, and content creators capitalize on digital opportunities."</p>
					<p>The group designs menus, mobile applications, games and features for digital platforms, and provides direct-to-consumer and online retail services that leverage both cloud-based storage system UltraViolet and digital copy.</p>
					<p>The group also provides market intelligence to help content owners know their consumers and plan accordingly.</p>
					<p>DADC has dedicated teams focused on cross-platform development, the development of social network entertainment experiences, content distribution and application creation. The company’s incubation and innovations team works on marketing campaigns and the delivery of cross-platform media across every device.</p>
					<p>Most recently Sony DADC’s LOOT — the internal development team in New Media Solutions — announced a new marriage of entertainment and social networking, creating real-time social experiences for feature films, TV, radio and live events in the PlayStation world. Using Crackle, Ustream and RadioIO channels, users can invite friends to share traditional entertainment experiences in a virtual goods environment and communicate with each other in real time.</p>
					<p>Other digital moves by DADC in the past year include:
					<ul>
						<li>Sony DADC launched its movieIQ feature in Europe, bringing the real-time Blu-ray movie database feature overseas after two years of availability in the states. DADC’s creative services department has pride in movieIQ, which offers up-to-date information on cast and crew and trivia on production, music and soundtracks, all tied to scenes of the film.
						<p>For the French release L’homme qui voulait vivre sa vie, Sony DADC’s European Java programming team went a step further, designing and programming an on-disc quiz game and including director insights and scene commentary.</p>
						<p>“Leveraging the reach of Sony DADC creative services’ global footprint, this international initiative was achieved by providing authoring, design and metadata content creation at the Paris facility, with movieIQ programming and development performed at the Salzburg and Los Angeles facilities,” Stewart Dickison, head of authoring and post-production, said at the time.</p></li>
						<li>DADC grew its games services division, specifically in the areas of digital delivery, for both developers and content owners.
						DADC’s biggest get was Ztorm, a service provider of digital distribution for movies and games, which chose DADC to help realize its digital rental model for games, giving consumers the ability to digitally rent games for a specific period of time before deciding whether or not to buy.
						<p>“Beside the ability to realize new and innovative business models requested by publishers, our gaming portfolio offers solutions from content enrichment, content monetization, content authentication through to market intelligence, with further services to be released and announced later this year,” Stefan Podhajski, director of product management at Sony DADC, said when the Ztorm agreement was announced. “These solutions ultimately provide the end-consumer with more flexibility and more value for money, adding downloadable content or try and buy options to the gaming experience.”</p></li>
						<li>BBC Worldwide sought out DADC for its new digital distribution platform, aiming for an easier way to distribute and market its assets, equal to more than 74,000 hours of programming per year licensed across every platform imaginable.
						<p>“Leveraging our extensive experience and solutions with large studios, Sony DADC provides BBC Worldwide the ability to benefit from a true global digital supply chain platform that will standardize their inventory, provide real-time management of their fulfillment and support their impressive growth across all new opportunities,” said Trey Bradley, EVP of video supply chain services.</p></li>
						<li>Via the LOOT Active Camera, DADC gave PlayStation users a new social experience allowing user-created content to be uploaded to both YouTube and PlayStation Home, the social gaming platform available on the PS3 system.</li>
