					<p><em>Crackle, Ustream, and RadioIO Channels Join Virtual World in LOOT™ Entertainment on Demand (EOD) System</em></p>
					<p>Los Angeles, CA — Entertainment and social networking come together like never before as Sony DADC’s LOOT™ group partners with leading digital media companies to bring virtual world experiences to feature films, television, radio, and live events to Sony Computer Entertainment America’s PlayStation®Home social game platform. With the addition of Crackle, Ustream, and RadioIO social experiences to PlayStation®Home, users can invite friends to share traditional entertainment experiences in a virtual environment, communicating with each other in real time—whether across town or on the other side of the world.</p>
					<p>“The PlayStation®Home platform provides an opportunity to change the way people interact with online media and our LOOT team thrives on introducing new types of fun and exciting experiences to PlayStation® users,” said David Sterling, vice president of business development at Sony DADC. “We are very excited to bring familiar social experiences from the real world into a virtual environment, so people around the globe can connect and communicate with each other while sharing their favorite movie, show, music, or event. This is the next big step in social networking and it will transform the way people consume media.”</p>
					<p>Created by LOOT, Sony DADC New Media Solutions’ internal development team, the PlayStation®Home real-time social game platform is available on PlayStation®Network to all users of the PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system. Users in North America are able to explore a world of entertainment and unparalleled interactive capabilities either using LOOT’s Public Theater virtual spaces which offer “Social Viewing” experiences with up to 60 users or invitation-only private spaces such as Sunset Yacht, Hollywood Hills House, and the LOOT Space Apartment where hosts can invite up to 11 friends to watch content together and communicate via voice and text. Now, PlayStation®Home users will be able to share the experience of the platform’s Entertainment on Demand (EOD) system with content provided by three leading online media companies.</p>
					<p>Crackle: Social viewing for feature films and TV<br>
					Crackle, a multi-platform video entertainment network features hundreds of full-length Hollywood movies and television shows plus Crackle originals. Short-form content from Crackle has been available on PlayStation®Home since November 2010; now, all Crackle content is available on the social platform, including movies such as STEP BROTHERS, RESIDENT EVIL, GLORY, A FEW GOOD MEN, and STARSHIP TROOPERS, TV shows such as “Married…with Children,” “NewsRadio,” and “Jackie Chan Adventures,” over 1,000 anime episodes including “Samurai X,” “Blood +,” and “Blue Exorcist,” and over 40 Crackle originals including the award-winning “The Bannen Way,” “Issues,” and “Why It Crackles.” New titles are added monthly. In a rich virtual world experience, user avatars can get together with friends in the LOOT Space Station public space, the LOOT Sunset Yacht personal space, and other spaces to watch ad-supported Crackle content on-demand. Real-time text and voice communications bring users together in the kind of shared experience movie and TV fans have always loved.</p>
					<p>Ustream: Real-time interactivity around live broadcasted shows<br>
					The Ustream network features online lifecasting and live video streaming produced by more than 12,500,000 registered users. PlayStation®Home will now feature a broad range of live Ustream events. Ustream content will be available in both public and personal LOOT spaces, allowing PlayStation®Home users to enjoy the entertainment of their choice, the way they choose.</p>
					<p>RadioIO: Streaming music pioneer takes listening social<br>
					RadioIO (IWDM.OB), PlayStation Home and LOOT bring another option for “Social Listening” to PlayStation®Home by recreating the social experience of listening and discovering music with your friends. The new LOOT virtual item called Entertainment On Demand Active Radio lets PlayStation®Home users invite friends into their private spaces, or listen on their own in the LOOT Space Station public space, to enjoy high-quality Internet radio from RadioIO with their choice of more than 60 music and talk channels from Classical, Jazz, Rock, and Pop to Hip Hop, R & B, Country, Electronic, Dance and many more specialty niches including live shows from nationally syndicated radio talk show host Bubba the Love Sponge® and additional programming from Shannon Burke and Dangerous Conversation with Scott “Ledge” Ledger. Concerts and sporting events will be available in the future, as well as virtual goods to extend the fan experience.</p>
