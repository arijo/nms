					<p><em>LOOT™ Active Camera Offers New Social Experiences via PlayStation®Home and YouTube™ — Takes Machinima Creation to the Next Level</em></p>
					<p>Los Angeles, CA, September 30, 2011—User-created content can now be recorded and uploaded to both YouTube™ and the PlayStation®3 (PS3™) computer entertainment system’s XrossMediaBar (XMB™) directly from PlayStation®Home with the new LOOT™ Active Camera. Developed by LOOT, Sony DADC’s Digital Services development team, the LOOT Active Camera features YouTube™ functionality and is available today in the LOOT store on PlayStation®Home, the social game platform available exclusively for PlayStation®Network on the PlayStation 3 system.</p>
					<p>The introduction of the LOOT Active Camera opens the door to new realms of social video content experiences. In the past, people who wanted to capture video from video games and other virtual environments had to invest in separate PC capture and recording equipment. Now, this capability is seamlessly integrated into the PlayStation®Home experience with the LOOT Active Camera allowing users to save and upload videos coupled with controls for recording and editing provided through the XMB™ Video Editor & Uploader so users can share with friends on YouTube and across social networks.</p>
					<p>Machinima creation using the PlayStation®Home platform has been a key focus for LOOT, which has been developing PlayStation®Home Machinima tools since it unveiled it’s first private spaces: The Living Room Stage Set 2, Ghostbuster’s™ Firehouse: On Location and the Modular Stage Set 3. “With more than 100 Machinima-related items already available in the LOOT store, the addition of the LOOT™ Active Camera will help Machinima artists take their productions to the next level and offer a fun new activity in PlayStation®Home to all our customers,” said David Sterling, vice president of business development at Sony DADC, “With the ability to now record and upload directly to YouTube or the PS3 XMB, it will be easier and less expensive than ever for people to realize their creative visions on the platform.”</p>
					<p>Seamless integration with YouTube makes it easier than ever for virtual videographers to share their productions across the globe. With more than 3 billion daily views, YouTube is the world’s largest video distribution platform as well as a top-tier social network through which millions of people connect, inform, and inspire each other every day.</p>

					<p><em>Sony DADC Digital Services Platform Unifies Global Territories — Delivering Content Visibility, Access, and Expedited Fulfilment</em></p>
					<p>Sony DADC, a leading provider of digital supply chain services for the media and entertainment industries, today announced it has partnered with BBC Worldwide to implement and operate a unified global asset management and distribution platform. The platform will provide extensive visibility, simplified access, and expedited fulfilment across all assets, channels, vendors, and deals that drive BBC Worldwide’s business. The Sony DADC solution is designed to enable more efficient processes for BBC Worldwide to deliver programmes to global markets quickly while meeting increasingly complex requirements to support new business models, formats, and consumer devices.</p>
					<p>Already one of the world’s most successful exporters of television programmes, BBC Worldwide has thrived in the world of digital content, with global syndication partnerships that includes: iTunes, Netflix (US), Amazon (US), LoveFilm (UK), Sohu.com (China), Yota (Russia) and Videx (Japan). To maintain this growth and capitalise fully on opportunities around the globe, BBC Worldwide needed a new distribution platform designed to expedite the worldwide delivery of content in a digital world.</p>
					<p>“At BBC Worldwide, volumes of content are rising quickly—from a current level of 74,000 hours per year of programming licensed across all platforms — and time to market is rapidly shrinking,” said Abigail Hughes, SVP, Sales Operations and Digital Distribution, BBC Worldwide. “To maintain optimal business performance, we want to deliver more content to all of our partners faster.”</p>
					<p>Sony DADC is providing BBC Worldwide with a comprehensive set of services that will enable the company to exchange content more effectively, optimise shared workflows, and interact more efficiently with strategic partners, vendors, post-production companies, and distributors. The platform is designed to provide visibility into every part of the company’s global business to understand the goals and deliverables for each market and territory, as well as the flexibility to provide the right level of support for their specific requirements and market development.</p>
					<p>Trey Bradley, EVP, Video Supply Chain Services, Sony DADC, said: “Leveraging our extensive experience and solutions with large studios, Sony DADC provides BBC Worldwide the ability to benefit from a true global digital supply chain platform that will standardise their inventory, provide real-time management of their fulfilment, and support their impressive growth across all new opportunities.”</p>
					<p>“It was important to partner with a vendor who both shared our vision, and could provide the full range of asset management and fulfilment capabilities we need to manage our digital assets on a global scale,” said Hughes. “By providing a system where people throughout our business can see the programme assets we have available, then get it to market faster, in more ways, we can truly realise the potential of our global brand and our outstanding content resources.”</p>
					<p>BBC Worldwide is due to go live with the global platform by the end of 2011.</p>
