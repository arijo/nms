					<p>Los Angeles, Calif., July 7, 2011 — The historic final mission of NASA’s Space Shuttle program —the launch of the Space Shuttle Atlantis — will be live-streamed in a special social viewing event featured on Sony Computer Entertainment America’s PlayStation®Home for PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system. PlayStation Home viewers will be able to watch Atlantis’ launch live at 11:26 a.m. EDT on July 8th via the NASA TV channel on Sony DADC’s LOOT Space Station Theatre within the Entertainment on Demand (EOD) system.</p>
					<p>Sony DADC, a leading provider of advanced digital media supply chain solutions and next-generation creative applications, utilized the internal development team, LOOT, to develop the proprietary EOD system which allows users to share the experience with friends within a social viewing environment via Bluetooth headsets. Users can also watch popular television shows, web series and other types of content—all from inside the PlayStation Home social game platform.</p>
					<p>“We’re honored to be able to present this historic event as a social viewing experience in PlayStation Home,” said David Sterling, Vice President, Business Development, Sony DADC. “It’s exciting to be able to deliver the ability for users to witness the final NASA Space Shuttle flight with their PlayStation® family.”</p>
					<p>Atlantis will embark on a 12-day mission to the International Space Station (ISS) and will carry the Raffaello multipurpose logistics module containing supplies and spare parts for the space station and its crew. It will be the 37th shuttle mission to the ISS.</p>
					<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for different communities to experience the thrill of human spaceflight together,” said David Weaver, NASA Associate Administrator for the Office of Communications. “NASA looks forward to sharing more of our endeavors with PlayStation® users.”</p>
					<p>In addition to live-streamed events, the free NASA TV channel on LOOT’s Space Station Theatre will feature hundreds of videos offering spectacular views of the universe from past and current NASA missions. A gallery of podcasts, showcasing several missions including the Mars Science Laboratory and Voyager spacecraft, also will be available from the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</p>
					<p>NASA TV is available as a live stream on a continuing basis through the Space Station Theatre and the PlayStation Home premium personal space, Sunset Yacht. The channel features coverage of NASA missions and events, documentaries, archival and other special programming. Other content available on Sunset Yacht includes Dilbert and The Tick, provided by Crackle, as well as popular web series such as HD Nation, Scam School, Film Riot and Digg Dialogg from Revision3.</p>
