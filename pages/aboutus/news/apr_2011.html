					<p><em>Sony DADC supports ‘Songs for Japan’ initiative</em></p>
					<p>Anif, Austria/Terre Haute, US, April 5, 2011 – As the world looks on in horror, Japan attempts to recover from the dreadful consequences of the earthquake that struck the north-east coastal region of the country, triggering a massive tsunami on March 11, 2011. Whilst damage at Sony DADC’s two Japanese production facilities was minimal and no staff injuries were sustained, the company is actively engaged in supporting its Japanese countrymen.</p>
					<p>Now, Sony DADC has joined a music initiative that sees all parts of the recording industry coming together to create an extraordinary CD music compilation featuring many of the planet’s leading artists. The proceeds from selling this compilation CD, entitled Songs for Japan , will be donated to the Japan Red Cross and used to finance disaster relief activity in the region affected by the earthquake and tsunami.</p>
					<p>In supporting this fund-raising initiative, Sony DADC joins forces with Warner Music Group, Universal Music, EMI and Sony Music Entertainment as well as major industry suppliers including Arvato Digital Services, AGI and Carthuplas. Working on an incredibly short timescale, Sony DADC has provided replication and packaging services to the creation of this landmark CD compilation.</p>
					<p>“I’m certain that not only Sony DADC, but every participant is proud to contribute to this ground-breaking music industry initiative,” commented Dieter Daum, President and CEO, Sony DADC. “ The Japanese music market is one of the largest and most progressive worldwide. Not only at Sony DADC, but the entire music recording industry is pleased to participate in this important fund-raising venture and give something back to the Japanese music-buying public. We would like to thank our supplier partners for their contributions to this project.”</p>
					<p>The CD includes many iconic songs from the last five decades, stretching from John Lennon’s Imagine and Bob Dylan’s Shelter From The Storm to more recent global hits from artists including Lady Gaga, The Black Eyed Peas and Kings of Leon. In total, 37 artists have donated their creative work to the compilation CD.</p>
