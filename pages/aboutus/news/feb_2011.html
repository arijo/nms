					<p><em>Last Discovery Shuttle launch will be the first live streaming event featured by the PlayStation®Home premium space.</em></p>
					<p>Los Angeles, California – Fans of NASA will have an opportunity to watch the final liftoff of Space Shuttle Discovery in a unique “social viewing” environment available through Sony Computer Entertainment America’s PlayStation®Home for PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system.</p>
					<p>A live stream of the launch of the Discovery will be shown on the new NASA TV Channel of the Sunset Yacht, a premium personal space from LOOT, Sony DADC’s interactive entertainment development team. The launch of Space Shuttle Discovery is scheduled for February 24th at 4:50 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.</p>
					<p>The launch of Discovery is the first live streaming event to be offered by Sunset Yacht, which debuted in December. The Sunset Yacht features LOOT’s proprietary Entertainment-On-Demand system which allows users to communicate via Bluetooth headsets while watching popular television shows, web series and other types of content—all from inside the PlayStation Home social gaming environment.</p>
					<p>“We’re excited about this new way for people to experience the exhilaration of human spaceflight as part of a larger community,” said David Weaver, NASA associate administrator for the Office of Communications. “In addition to the other two shuttle launches planned for April and June, NASA looks forward to sharing more of our endeavors with PlayStation users.”</p>
					<p>In addition to the live streamed events, users will be able to access hundreds of videos on demand (VOD) offering spectacular views of the universe from past and current NASA missions. This large selection of videos and podcasts are courtesy of NASA and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
					<p>“The launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery provides a wonderful opportunity to introduce people to the fun of social viewing,” said David Sterling, vice president business development, LOOT. “Users can share this experience with their friends, regardless of where those friends happen to be in the world.”</p>
					<p>Following Discovery’s launch, NASA TV will continue to be available through Sunset Yacht as a live stream. NASA TV features coverage of NASA missions and events, plus documentaries, archival and other special programming. Other content available of Sunset Yacht includes Dilbert and The Tick, provided by Crackle, as well as popular web series such as HD Nation, Scam School, Penn Point with Penn Jillette, Film Riot and Digg Dialogg from Revision3, the leading television network for the internet generation.</p>
