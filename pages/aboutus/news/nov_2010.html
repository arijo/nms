					<p><em>Revolutionary Digital Supply Chain Gets Media Products into Consumers’ Hands<br>
					Faster to Capitalize On Booming Global Demand</em></p>
					<p>Sony DADC Digital Services, a leader in digital supply chain management for the media and entertainment industries, today introduced innovative new services that enable content owners and distributors to operate with the speed, efficiency, and accuracy today’s dynamic global markets require. Previously, companies seeking to capitalize on surging consumer demand for music, video, software, games, and other media struggled with the complexity and cost of legacy systems, technology, and processes. Now, a new line of digital solutions from Sony DADC Digital Services will empower these companies to respond quickly to emerging opportunities, capture new markets, adapt to evolving business models, and achieve higher levels of operational performance.</p>
					<p>The new service line offers customers fully-integrated, real-time digital tools that automate and accelerate processes throughout the content lifecycle:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>An advanced digital distribution system built to overcome the limitations of current legacy offerings by delivering improved speed, simplicity, and control through newly-automated processes across the entire content lifecycle — from release planning through delivery and monetization.</li>
						<li>Fully integrated client onboarding, customer management, and communication services, that enable content providers and their partners to connect quickly and easily in a centrally managed environment with distribution partners anywhere in the world – providing true global communication and fulfillment while eliminating outdated email-only based processes.</li>
						<li>Aspect℠, the industry’s first fully-integrated media inventory visualization solution, reduces the time and cost to prepare media assets by performing inventory validation, logging, and content preparation simultaneously to create technical, contextual, and visual metadata for media assets.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To provide customers with the ability to check the progress of orders on-the-go, Sony DADC built a first-of-its-kind mobile application that enables customers to view and manage order status and asset statistics for real-time information anytime, anywhere. Additional services in development include tools to help content owners protect revenue by ensuring contract adherence and a business intelligence service to help them make optimal decisions about their content and prepare proactively for emerging market opportunities.</p>
					<p>“The speed at which consumers can access and affect demand of content is nearly instantaneous. At the same time, content owners and distributors are struggling to navigate rapidly changing business models, the complexity of rights and formats for every release, speed-to-market expectations, global requirements, and unpredictability of the next big thing. The industry’s legacy systems and processes simply cannot keep up,” said Michael Frey, president, Sony DADC Digital Services. “We built a unique digital supply chain that specifically addresses these challenges and enables us to respond faster and more effectively, so our customers can get consumers what they want, when and how they want it.”</p>
					<p>To develop the requirements for a complete, fully-integrated digital media supply chain, Sony DADC Digital Services sought input from numerous content companies and partnered closely with Sony Pictures Entertainment, drawing on their firsthand insight into today’s global media markets to create a solution that meets the full range of industry needs. Proven technology and innovation from top industry providers Capgemini, Cognizant, and Microsoft power crucial elements of the solutions.</p>
					<p>Sony DADC Digital Services opened a newly-renovated facility for video services equipped with state-of-the-art systems which, at 22,000 square feet, is a fraction of the size of legacy distribution houses due to the efficiencies gained through automation and a clean-slate approach. The facility joins a global network of 12 facilities and 350 employees dedicated to providing innovative digital services and regional expertise with global distribution partners.
