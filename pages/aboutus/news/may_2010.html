					<p>The untimely death of a superstar sparks 2.6 million downloads in a single week. A karaoke queen becomes a global sensation overnight. The trailer for a teenage saga is viewed online 10.6 million times in a single week; another trailer, for the remake of a beloved sci-fi series, gets more than 5 million downloads in five days from a single website. It goes without saying that in today’s entertainment industry, fan’s reign supreme. Their enthusiasm determines everything from the next hit songs, shows, and games to the channels and formats they’ll be consumed in. And while we never know when or where the next overnight craze will materialize— when it hits, you’ve got to ready to jump on these fleeting opportunities or they’ll disappear forever.</p>
					<p>With over 150 million people watching online video and consumers now spending billions of dollars annually on digitally distributed content there is a huge opportunity in front of us – one that we can’t squander because of slow moving systems and processes developed for an earlier era. The decisions fans make are changing our industry faster than we ever would have imagined. So it begs the question. How can our industry effectively respond to consumers’ ever growing demand for instant gratification and how do we prevent outdated processes and legacy systems from limiting future commercial opportunities?</p>
					<p>Dreaming of the Future — Living in the Past</p>
					<p>We work in an environment where legacy systems and processes are being used to support new and emerging digital delivery models and they simply can not keep up. We’ve been treating digital media as if it were just another brand of tape. Rather than having a new breed of digital-native distribution companies to build digital supply chains, it’s fallen on post houses to graft digital services onto their own legacy business models and systems. Unfortunately, there’s little real automation, poor end-to-end visibility, limited potential for scale, and an infrastructure that wasn’t built to support cycle times based in hours, product life cycle management or multi-channel digital distribution. Existing processing and editing tools are not easily integrated, and there are still lots of people manually manipulating elements and accounting for all this exception processing in the back room. With all the financial pressures facing our industry we must do better with our Digital Supply Chain.</p>
					<p>In fact, we have to do better. The current cumbersome, labor-intensive digital media processes cost us a lot more than maddening inconvenience and a few dollars around the margins—they represent a major obstacle in getting our product to market, and cause us to leave money on the table every day of the year. There are also everyday challenges of inaccurate data sources or unclean metadata that can clog the system and impair our ability to turn product around quickly. These issues are nothing new—but the consequences are higher than ever: the speed at which consumers can now access and affect demand is nearly instantaneous. And this demand is highly perishable: if we miss an opportunity today, consumers will likely forget about it by tomorrow With more than 20,000 physical retailers, broadcasters and over 600 digital retailers to supply—multiplied by the proliferating products and specifications each one requires – the complexity of the business is not getting easier with digital delivery as many people once believed.</p>
					<p>Getting Serious about Digital</p>
					<p>Satisfying the incredible consumer demand in today’s fast-growing global entertainment markets requires us to leverage proven supply chain capabilities and more nimble systems platforms that can enable fast yet well structured and managed content delivery across traditional and emerging channels. The obstacles are already well know and we can overcome them by applying proven supply chain strategies, technologies, and analytics to the new digital environment so that we are positioned to proactively respond to the next consumer opportunity. The next-generation digital supply chain requires a more structured release planning and management of commercial assets and marketing collateral as well as visibility of assets throughout the production and delivery process. The ability to continuously plug in new editing and processing tools as well as analytics that enable continuous streamlining of the delivery platform as demands evolve is critical to avoiding premature obsolescence. Being prepared before demand is generated with pre-cleared rights, transformed assets, and metadata as clean and complete as possible is also critical. We can then execute with speed, quality and efficiency across every stage of the distribution process. Every link in the digital supply chain can be tuned to service the life cycle of our product and the exploitation channels our consumers demand.</p>
					<p>An opportunity in today’s environment often looks like this: you’ve got a hot piece of content and markets that are hungry for it. Calls are made to your service provider(s): we need to get The Rise of Digital to Hulu, iTunes, and Comcast ASAP. These requests are often handled separately: research the title, collect rights information, get the files together, look up the partner’s requirements, assemble it, transform it, put it in the mail—even if someone else in the company already did all the same things last week—then start over for the next order. Compare this with the new digital supply chain: the requester is presented with the ease and simplicity of an online consumer application: the service provider or content owner checks a few boxes on the screen identifies the content, delivery dates and the DSPs. The system looks through your inventory to see exactly what’s available, in which formats, and determines the most practical, efficient source to pull from for each of these orders. It can even determine which source can be used to meet all three sets of requirements most easily, with the least transformation along the way. The whole process takes minutes and your orders are out the door.</p>
					<p>Getting paid for these opportunities is also streamlined in the new model. By updating our business systems from end to end— planning, order management, fulfillment, billing and accounting – information can flow seamlessly across the platform. Visibility is maintained throughout the delivery cycle and the status of each project or order is available at a glance whether at your pc or through an app on your smart phone.</p>
					<p>But it’s not just a matter of getting things done more efficiently. By simplifying and improving processes across the digital supply chain, and automating them with a rules-based engine that incorporates proven best practices, we can ensure more consistent, accurate decision-making across the entire lifecycle. Full visibility and accountability into both manual and automated processes give us insight at a glance to determine the most effective way to handle activities around the globe.</p>
					<p>The Potential is even Greater</p>
					<p>Much of the value of a digital supply chain is that it brings predictability into a world that has been the Wild West until now. It’s hard to know what new request is coming tomorrow, or where it’s coming from. This has made it extremely challenging to develop digital delivery solutions when the target keeps moving.</p>
					<p>But in all of these one-off requests patterns are emerging behind the scenes similar to those we’ve seen in other industries. Analytics and standards make possible a new level of predictive reasoning: using data mining to see what’s coming—where the emerging markets are, what their requirements will be, the kinds of content they will want – so we can prepare in advance. In other words, while working on today’s orders, behind the scenes the system is already transforming assets and pre-clearing rights for the orders that will come tomorrow, next week, next month. By taking this insight into marketing, positioning, and merchandising that we’ve developed in the physical environment for decades, and bringing it into the digital world, we can accelerate our entire business supply chain and deliver content where and when it is needed.</p>
					<p>At that point, the big picture comes into focus: as transformative as it is, the digital supply chain is only the foundation for the strategies, services, and capabilities we build on top of it. As we keep driving its evolution, our vision goes beyond processing and transportation to encompass the way our entire industry does business. We respond faster and more accurately to impulsive consumer tastes and get them what they want, when they want it, the way they want it. It’s a future worth getting excited about for consumers and the industry alike—and it’s coming sooner than you can imagine.</p>
